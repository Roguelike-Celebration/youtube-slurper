# YouTube Slurper

This is a repo intended to help us fetch video metadata from our YouTube channel and dump the metadata into a Google Sheet.

### Local setup
This currently must be run locally.

To run this locally, you need various pieces of config you can fetch from our password manager. There's a file called "env.txt" in the password manager entry â€” download this, rename it to `.env`, and put it in the same directory as this project.

The API keys were generated by going to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and generating an API key restricted to accessing the YouTube Data API v3, and creating a 'web application' OAuth client.

Run `npm install` to set up dependencies, then `parcel dev` to start a local server. It should be live at `http://localhost:1234/index.html`.


### Using the tool
This whole flow could be improved; it is what it is.

Go to the URL in Chrome. On load, it immediately generates a login popup. You will likely need to tell Chrome to always allow popups, then refresh the page. It will warn you the application isn't authorized, approve it anyway.

There's a switch in code (two lines in `google.ts` where you comment one out) to determine whether we fetch live data from YouTube or use a cached copy.
