# YouTube slurper

This is a repo intended to help us fetch video metadata from our YouTube channel.

### Using the tool
Run it in Chrome. On load, it immediately generates a login popup. You will likely need to tell Chrome to always allow popups, then refresh the page. This could be improved; it is what it is.


### Local setup
To run this locally, you need an API key and an OAuth client ID. This exists in our password manager. There's a file called "env.txt" in the password manager entry â€” download this, rename it to `.env`, and put it in the same directory as this project.

These keys was generated by going to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and generating an API key restricted to accessing the YouTube Data API v3, and creating a 'web application' OAuth client.
